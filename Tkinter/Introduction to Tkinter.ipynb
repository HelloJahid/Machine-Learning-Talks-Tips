    "<h3> <font color=\"blue\" size=\"4\">   PyQT    </font> </h3>PyQT is one of the favored cross-platform Python bindings implementing the Qt library for the Qt application development framework. Nokia primarily owns Qt. Currently, PyQT is available for almost all operating systems like Unix/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X. It blends the best of Python and Qt and provides flexibility to the programmer to decide whether to create a program by writing a pure python code or use Qt Designer to create visual dialogs.\n",

    "\n",
    "<h3> <font color=\"blue\" size=\"4\">   Kivy    </font> </h3> Kivy is for the creation of new user interfaces and is an OpenGL ES 2 accelerated framework. Much like PyQt, Kivy also supports almost all platforms like Windows, MacOSX, Linux, Android, iOS. It is an open-source framework and comes with over 20 pre-loaded widgets in its toolkit.\n",

    "<h3> <font color=\"blue\" size=\"4\">   Jython    </font> </h3>Jython is a Python port for Java, which gives Python scripts seamless access to Java class libraries on the local machine.\n",

    "<h3> <font color=\"blue\" size=\"4\">   WxPython    </font> </h3>\n",
    "WxPython, initially known as WxWindows (now as a WxWidgets library), is an open-source abstract-level wrapper for cross-platform GUI library. It is implemented as a Python expansion module. With WxPython, you, as a developer, can create native applications for Windows, Mac OS, and Unix.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> <font color=\"blue\" size=\"4\">   PyGUI    </font> </h3> PyGUI is a graphical application cross-platform framework for Unix, Macintosh, and Windows. Compared to some other GUI frameworks, PyGUI is by far the simplest and lightweight of them all, as the API is purely in sync with Python.PyGUI inserts very less code between the GUI platform and Python application; hence, the display of the application usually displays the natural GUI of the platform.\n",
